# Mathematica code for f(R, G, \phi) early dark energy model
## Abstract
This project contains mathematica code used to calculate the cosmology evolution equation of the early dark energy model trigged by spacetime dynamics during radiation matter transition.  The version of mathematica we're using is mathematica13, and make sure you've downloaded the Xact package before you go ahead with this code
